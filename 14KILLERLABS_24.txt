Tasks

The Operations team started configuring several monitoring activities. Complete the configurations for the tasks below.

1. Complete the Flexible NetFlow Flow Exporter configuration on R1 to send data to the collector using UDP port 2055.
2. Configure the switch port analyzer on Sw1 and mirror all communication to and from PC1 to interface E1/1 using session number 11.
3. Schedule the pre-configured IP SLA operation on R1 to start running immediately and to run indefinitely.

Topology; See NetflowLab

Solution

Note: All the parameters (port, IP addresses, session number, IP SLA number…) may be different so please check them carefully.

Task 1. Complete the Flexible NetFlow Flow Exporter configuration on R1 to send data to the collector using UDP port 2055.

We should use “show run” command to check if there is any existed Flow Exporter or not. If not we can define any name for it. 

Suppose the name of the Flow Exporter here is “MyFlowExporter”.

We are not sure the IP address of NetFlow Collector. If we can access Sw1, use “show run” command to check if we can find it. 

Suppose the NetFlow Collector here is PC2 with IP address 10.14.1.2. We will use it in “destination” command below:

On R1:

flow exporter MyFlowExporter
 destination 10.14.1.2
 transport udp 2055
 export-protocol netflow-v9
 
 
Task 2. Configure the switch port analyzer on Sw1 and mirror all communication to and from 

PC1 to interface E1/1 using session number 11.

PC1 is on interface e0/1 of the switch so we will monitor this interface:

On Sw1:

monitor session 11 source interface e0/1 both
monitor session 11 destination interface e1/1


Task 3. Schedule the pre-configured IP SLA operation on R1 to start running immediately and to run indefinitely.

First we need to find out the IP SLA number which was preconfigured with “show run” command.

R1#show run
...
ip sla 5
...


Suppose the IP SLA number we found is 5. We will use this number in the next command.

On Sw1:

Sw1(config)#ip sla schedule 5 life forever start-time now

Solution:

Task 1. Sw20 is actively attempting to negotiate an 802.1 trunking EtherChannel with Sw10 using LACP, 

but the channel is not functional. Resolve the issues on Sw10.

Please make sure all the configuration under e0/0 to e0/2 must match with the configuration under

Port-channel 11 (except the “channel-group 11 mode active” command under physical interfaces e0/0 to e0/2).

OSPF is preconfigured on all devices except R20. Configure R20 to complete these tasks.

Tasks

Task 1. Configure OSPF according to the topology using these requirements:
+ Use Process ID 20.
+ Use Loopback0 for the Router ID.
+ Advertise all networks into OSPF.
— Do not use network statements under the OSPF process to accomplish this task.

Task 2. Configure a /18 summary route for Area 40.
+ Advertise only Type 3 LSAs into Area 0.

Topology:

Task 1.

First we need to find out the Loopback 0 IP address of R20 with the “show run” or 

“show ip interface brief”. Suppose it is 20.20.20.20.

On R20:

router ospf 20
 router-id 20.20.20.20
 
To advertise all networks of R20 into OSPF without using the “network” command, 

we need to enable OSPF on each interface:

config t
interface loopback0
 ip ospf 20 area 0
interface e0/0
 ip ospf 20 area 0
interface e0/1
 ip ospf 20 area 0

Tasks

eBGP is configure on R2 and R3. Configure R1 to complete these tasks
1. Using the address-family command, configure eBGP according to the topology. Use Loopback0 for the router-id.
2. Advertise R1’s Loopback 0, 1, and 2 networks to AS 200 and AS 300.

Task 1. Using the address-family command, configure eBGP according to the topology. Use Loopback0 for the router-id.

Please check the IP address of Loopback0 interface with the command “show ip int brief” or “show run”. Suppose it is 10.1.1.100 in this case.

On R1:

config t
router bgp 100

  neighbor 209.165.202.130 activate
  
  
Task 2. Advertise R1’s Loopback 0, 1, and 2 networks to AS 200 and AS 300.

On R1:

Note: Suppose we are still under “address-family ipv4” mode from task 1.

With BGP, we have to advertise the networks with the exact subnet masks which are configured on each interface. 

Therefore, with loopback 1 it should be “209.165.201.0 mask 255.255.255.248″ and with loopback 2 it should 

be “209.165.201.8 mask 255.255.255.248″.

On R1, type these commands (under “address-family ipv4” mode from task 1):
  
config t
network 10.1.1.100 mask 255.255.255.255
network 209.165.201.0 mask 255.255.255.248
network 209.165.201.8 mask 255.255.255.248

Verification

On R1, we can check if the eBGP neighbor relationship came up with the “show ip bgp summary” command:

R1#show ip bgp summary 
--output omitted--

Neighbor        V           AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down  State/PfxRcd

209.165.202.130 4          300      13      13        4    0    0 00:08:35        0

We see in the “State/PfxRcd” field there are numbers (“0” in this case) which means the eBGP neighbor relationship came up.

Note: R2 and R3 do not advertise any networks to R1 so the Prefix received (PfxRcd) is 0 here.

Also on either R2 or R3, use the “show ip bgp” command to see if the three networks on R1 have been advertised to this router:

On R2 or R3:

EXAMQUESTIONS2:

Tasks:

The operations team started configuring network devices for a new site. 
Complete the configurations to achieve these goals:

1. Configure Rapid PVST+ on SW20.

2. The trunk between SW20 and SW30 is not operational. 
Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.

3. The LACP port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational. 
Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC2 (10.10.100.20) across the port channel.

Note: No access is provided to SW10 or SW30. Resolve these issues by making 
changes only to SW20. Traffic on all trunks should be restricted to only active VLANs.

Task 1. Configure Rapid PVST+ on SW20.

On SW20:

SW20#conf t
SW20(config)#spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst

Task 2. The trunk between SW20 and SW30 is not operational. Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.

SW20(config)#interface e0/0
SW20(config-if)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW20(config-if)#switchport mode trunk

Verification

Open PC3 and try pinging to PC1 (you have to wait for about 1 minute before the ping can work):

PC3#ping 10.10.100.10
!!!!!

Task 3. The LACP port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational.
 Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping
 PC2 (10.10.100.20) across the port channel.
 
Use the “show etherchannel summary” command on SW20 to check the issue. 
Maybe both Etherchannel interfaces were not configured anything or set to passive
 or use PAgP instead (with “desirable” or “auto” mode).
 Therefore we must change to “active” mode.
 
Use the “show run” command on SW20 to check if there is a preconfigured Port-channel
 interface or not. If there is then we must use this port-channel number for our config.
 Suppose 
there is a preconfigured “interface Port-channel 10”
 so we need to use the “channel-group 10 …” command:
 
//Please check the channel-group number carefully. We suppose it is 10 here.
SW20(config)#int range e0/2 - 3
SW20(config-if-range)#channel-group 10 mode active

Note: If we see this error:

%EC-5-CANNOT_BUNDLE2: Et0/2 is not compatible with Po10 and will be suspended 
(trunk encap of Et0/2 is auto, Po10 is dot1q)
%EC-5-CANNOT_BUNDLE2: Et0/3 is not compatible with Po10 and will be suspended
 (trunk encap of Et0/3 is auto, Po10 is dot1q)
The cause of this error is Po10 is created before grouping e0/2 & e0/2 so we must make sure our physical interfaces are compatible 
with Po10. We need two additional commands:

SW20(config)#int range e0/2 - 3
SW20(config-if-range)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW20(config-if-range)#switchport mode trunk

If the Po10 interface is still not up then please check if Po10
 has any other commands that E0/2 – 3 interfaces do not have. We may need another command:

SW20(config-if-range)#switchport trunk allowed vlan 500
if this command exists on Po10.

Verification

Maybe we should shutdown the e0/0 interface of SW20 to make sure the ping goes through the port channel:

SW20(config)#int e0/0
SW20(config-if)#shut

PC3#ping 10.10.100.20
!!!!!

Then “no shut” e0/0 (suppose we are under int 0/0 of SW20 already):

SW20(config-if)#no shut

Tasks

The Operations team started configuring several monitoring activities. Complete the configurations for the tasks below.

1. Complete the Flexible NetFlow Flow Exporter configuration on R1 to send data to the collector using UDP port 2055.
2. Configure the switch port analyzer on Sw1 and mirror all communication to and from PC1 to interface E1/1 using session number 11.
3. Schedule the pre-configured IP SLA operation on R1 to start running immediately and to run indefinitely.

Topology; See NetflowLab

Solution

Note: All the parameters (port, IP addresses, session number, IP SLA number…) may be different so please check them carefully.

Task 1. Complete the Flexible NetFlow Flow Exporter configuration on R1 to send data to the collector using UDP port 2055.

We should use “show run” command to check if there is any existed Flow Exporter or not. If not we can define any name for it. 

Suppose the name of the Flow Exporter here is “MyFlowExporter”.

We are not sure the IP address of NetFlow Collector. If we can access Sw1, use “show run” command to check if we can find it. 

Suppose the NetFlow Collector here is PC2 with IP address 10.14.1.2. We will use it in “destination” command below:

On R1:

flow exporter MyFlowExporter
 destination 10.14.1.2
 transport udp 2055
 export-protocol netflow-v9
 
 
Task 2. Configure the switch port analyzer on Sw1 and mirror all communication to and from 

PC1 to interface E1/1 using session number 11.

PC1 is on interface e0/1 of the switch so we will monitor this interface:

On Sw1:

monitor session 11 source interface e0/1 both
monitor session 11 destination interface e1/1


Task 3. Schedule the pre-configured IP SLA operation on R1 to start running immediately and to run indefinitely.

First we need to find out the IP SLA number which was preconfigured with “show run” command.

R1#show run
...
ip sla 5
...


Suppose the IP SLA number we found is 5. We will use this number in the next command.

On Sw1:

Sw1(config)#ip sla schedule 5 life forever start-time now

 network 209.165.201.15 mask 255.255.255.255
 
Verification

Check on R1, R2 to see if they have the IP addresses of Lo100 & Lo200 interfaces of R3
in their routing table
with the “show ip route bgp” (or “show ip route” or “show ip bgp”) command.

Tasks:

The operations team started configuring network devices for a new site. 
Complete the configurations to achieve these goals:

1. Configure Rapid PVST+ on SW20.

2. The trunk between SW20 and SW30 is not operational. 
Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.

3. The LACP port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational. 
Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC2 (10.10.100.20) across the port channel.

Note: No access is provided to SW10 or SW30. Resolve these issues by making 
changes only to SW20. Traffic on all trunks should be restricted to only active VLANs.

Task 1. Configure Rapid PVST+ on SW20.

On SW20:

SW20#conf t
SW20(config)#spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst

Task 2. The trunk between SW20 and SW30 is not operational. Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.

SW20(config)#interface e0/0
SW20(config-if)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW20(config-if)#switchport mode trunk

Verification

Open PC3 and try pinging to PC1 (you have to wait for about 1 minute before the ping can work):

PC3#ping 10.10.100.10
!!!!!

Task 3. The LACP port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational.
 Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping
 PC2 (10.10.100.20) across the port channel.
 
Use the “show etherchannel summary” command on SW20 to check the issue. 
Maybe both Etherchannel interfaces were not configured anything or set to passive
 or use PAgP instead (with “desirable” or “auto” mode).
 Therefore we must change to “active” mode.
 
Use the “show run” command on SW20 to check if there is a preconfigured Port-channel
 interface or not. If there is then we must use this port-channel number for our config.
 Suppose 
there is a preconfigured “interface Port-channel 10”
 so we need to use the “channel-group 10 …” command:
 
//Please check the channel-group number carefully. We suppose it is 10 here.
SW20(config)#int range e0/2 - 3
SW20(config-if-range)#channel-group 10 mode active

Note: If we see this error:

%EC-5-CANNOT_BUNDLE2: Et0/2 is not compatible with Po10 and will be suspended 
(trunk encap of Et0/2 is auto, Po10 is dot1q)
%EC-5-CANNOT_BUNDLE2: Et0/3 is not compatible with Po10 and will be suspended
 (trunk encap of Et0/3 is auto, Po10 is dot1q)
The cause of this error is Po10 is created before grouping e0/2 & e0/2 so we must make sure our physical interfaces are compatible 
with Po10. We need two additional commands:

SW20(config)#int range e0/2 - 3
SW20(config-if-range)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW20(config-if-range)#switchport mode trunk

If the Po10 interface is still not up then please check if Po10
 has any other commands that E0/2 – 3 interfaces do not have. We may need another command:

SW20(config-if-range)#switchport trunk allowed vlan 500
if this command exists on Po10.

Verification

Maybe we should shutdown the e0/0 interface of SW20 to make sure the ping goes through the port channel:

SW20(config)#int e0/0
SW20(config-if)#shut

PC3#ping 10.10.100.20
!!!!!

Then “no shut” e0/0 (suppose we are under int 0/0 of SW20 already):

SW20(config-if)#no shut

Task 3. Configure static routing on R10 and R20 so that users in VLAN 100 and VLAN 101 that belong to the
CORP VRF are able to communicate with each other. Tunnel0 should be the only interface used to route
traffic for the CORP VRF.
